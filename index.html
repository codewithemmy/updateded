       <button class="submit1" disabled>Oil & Gas / Environmental Law
        <p>
          By available records both nationally and internationally, 90percent of
          Nigeria's gross earnings come from oil and gas activities. this
          includes explorations, exploitations and marketings. Not unxpectedly,
          environmental challenges also come with it. Our law firm cannot
          rightly ignore these, moreso with our background and training in the
          oil rich city of Port Harcourt, from where our skills began. Over the
          years, we have represented organisations in preparing contracts,
          negotiating appropriate compensations and remedial measures in cases
          of oil spillages amongst many other professional services.
        </p>
       </button>
      <button class="submit1" disabled>
        Property Law / Labour / Employment
        <p>
          Oil, Gas and environment is a specie of property. The other specie is
          real property. Many times, activities of the former impacts on,
          sprouts from and into the latter. Often, such inquiries as the
          applicable laws, appropriate tittles are common place. Additionally,
          sometimes workers and their skills, including their proper deployment
          occupy a prime stage in organisations. Such specific issues as
          industrial accidents, employment and wages, lay offs and redundancies
          could often be on the spot where our services are often called upon
          for use.
        </p>
      </button>
      <button class="submit1" disabled>Insolvencies
        <p>
          Among members of the business community, it is common knowledge that
          Nigeria's economy is fragile. The fragility here is a consequence of
          both weak macro and micro factors. The inevitable sequence becomes the
          need to factor in possible business failures and possible exit routes
          that guarantee minimum scars in each possible business scenario. This
          is our meaning of Insolvencies. Our knowledge, skills, network of
          relationships and experience garnared over a period three decades make
          our firm outstanding in this area of the law. Some of our clients
          include Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria<sub>1 (AMCON)</sub> 
          which is the biggest wharehouse in Nigeria.
        </p>
      </button>
       
      <button class="submit1" disabled>Corporate Practice & Taxation  <p>
        Since the celebrated English case of Salomon vs Salomon, a body of
        laws, rules and regulations have emerged in the bid to keep the ever
        expanding world of business within legal limits. Some are national,
        while others are international. Alongside this is an equally expanding
        tax rule designed to guarantee revenues for sovereign governments. Our
        services include guiding organisations to keep faith with these ever
        expanding laws while guaranteeing returns to thier shareholders.
      </p></button>
    
      <button class="submit1" disabled>
        Trademarks, Patents & Copyrights
        <p>
          Organisations operate and make profits by what they stand for, invent
          and propagate. Regularly, we are called upon to protect them from
          unauthorized parties. This is what we have done creditably well for
          our clients over the years. Would you not rather benefit from this
          pool of experience?
        </p>
      </button>
   
      <button class="submit1" disabled>Arbitrations
        <p>
          In recent years, court room litigations, with all their drawbacks are
          losing attraction for a growing number of business organizations. This
          is worse in developing economies where they are becoming increasingly
          less attractive on account of it's many limitations. Our law firm
          recognises this and thus encourages our clients to explore the many
          advantages of Arbitration. In this direction, we are equipped for
          this, being a very important tool in the 21st century business world.
        </p>

      <button class="submit1" disabled>Notaries Public
        <p>
          In Nigeria, the Chief Justice of Nigeria is empowered by the Notaries
          Public ACT, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria CAP.... to appoint fit
          and proper persons as Notaries Public for Nigeria. This appointment,
          our principal partner holds by virtue of a certificate issued under
          the hand of the Chief Justice of Nigeria dated .......... He has been
          holding that office ever since.
